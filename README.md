Brooklyn Prison Department has decided to store information about prisoners it holds (as well as other
prison data) in a database. 

The company has wisely chosen to hire you as a database designer.

• Each prisoner serving time at Brooklyn Prison has a unique SSN, name, address, phone number, and other details.

• Each prisoner has committed one or more crimes and is serving time in prison based on it.

• Each prison in Brooklyn has multiple blocks in it. Each block in turn has multiple cells in them.

• Based on the capacity and the type of the cell, it may host one or more inmates within it.

• Each of the blocks in a prison is guarded by one or more guards. These guards work in shifts and may be transferred to a different prison location.

• The guards also monitor the behavior of the prisoners in the cell and record their feedback to facilitate their correction.

• The Prison Department has several supervisors who monitor and all guards of different blocks.

• The Supervisor has the power to approve to disprove a visitor visiting a prisoner.

• The Supervisor also has the power to view/ update prisoner/ guard data in the database.

• A Visitor who visits a prisoner after the supervisor's approval does so on a particular date within the visitation time.

• Visitors can sign up and submit requests for visitation to a prisoner.

• To manage all this data, we have a Database Management Admin, who solely has the right to add/remove Supervisors after logging in to the system.
